        "- Simple Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables:\n",
        "\n",
        "- One independent variable (also called the predictor or explanatory variable, usually denoted as X)\n",
        "\n",
        "- One dependent variable (also called the response or target variable, usually denoted as Y)\n",
        "2. What are the key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression?\n",
        "-\n",
        "The key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression ensure that the model provides valid, reliable, and interpretable results. Here's a clear breakdown of each:\n",
        "- 1. Linearity\n",

        "- 2. Independence of Errors\n",
        "- Assumption: The residuals (errors) are independent of each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Why it matters: Violation (e.g., in time series data) leads to underestimated standard errors.\n",

        "- Check: Durbin-Watson test (for detecting autocorrelation in residuals).\n",
        "-  Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance of Errors)\n",
        "- 3. Assumption: The residuals have constant variance across all levels of X.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Why it matters: Unequal spread (heteroscedasticity) can make predictions less reliable.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Check: Plot residuals vs predicted values — the spread should be consistent.\n",
        "-  4. Normality of Errors\n",
